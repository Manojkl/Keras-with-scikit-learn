# Keras-with-scikit-learn
The Keras library provide a deep learning wrapper for a classification and regression estimator in scikit-learn. Same is implemented using banknote dataset.
Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. 

## Banknote
For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images. <br />

## Pima Indians Diabetes Database
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
